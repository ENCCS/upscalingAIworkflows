Upscaling AI Workflows
============================

Artificial Intelligence (AI) has become a foundational building block
of our modern world.  Accordingly, a vast effort has been put into
bringing AI to researchers and practitioners of a wide range of
fields.  Nonetheless, the computationally intensive task of training
an AI increasingly requires more computational power than what our
laptops and PCs can offer. Therefore, the ability to develop and train
a neural network on large clusters seems imperative. This workshop
teaches us how to scale an AI-powered application in large clusters,
i.e., supercomputers.

.. prereq::

   Working knowledge of Unix OS is required. In addition, a basic
   understanding of Neural Networks (NNs) is desirable.  Please follow
   the `link <https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/>`_ to install docker 
   locally on your laptop as we need to use it for some part of the 
   begininng of this workshop. Details of using and accessing to 
   the Vega cluster are given in :doc:`setup` section.

This lesson material is developed by the `EuroCC National Competence Center
Sweden (ENCCS) <https://enccs.se/>`_ and taught in ENCCS workshops. It aims
at researchers and developers who have experience working with AI and wish to train their applications on supercomputers.
The lesson material is licensed under `CC-BY-4.0

Docker provides plenty of educational materials for users. Therefore, checking `Docker official website <https://docs.docker.com/get-started/>`_
is highly recommended. The same can be stated about `Singularity <https://sylabs.io/guides/latest/user-guide/>`_
, where one can find many compelling examples with relevant details.

TensorFlow and Horovorod documentation are also good sources of learning about commands
and their proper use.
